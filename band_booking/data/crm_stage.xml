    TIP : The Curator's confirmed contact is an identified way to get in touch with the
    "human" that will make the real decision to select your project.

    At this stage, you only "think" this contact is the Curator's. It is a good practice
    to change the Curator's "Odoo Contact" form status to "Checked" only when you
    receive a real answer from this contact.

    TIP : This stage corresponds to the famous "I will return you back if I am
    interested", but sent by a real person. It is a good practice to avoid moving to
    "Received by Curator" if the received answer is obviously sent by an automatic mail.

    If the answer is trustworthy, the Curator's "Odoo Contact" form status should be
    changed to "Checked".

    TIP : The famous "Are you free on this date ?". The Curator could have asked

    you know if his/her budget is suitable with yours.
